When is tears of the kingdom release date?
answer: Tears of the kingdom release date is May 12, 2023.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is coming to Nintendo Switch on May 12. It’ll cost $69.99, the first first-party Nintendo Switch game to carry that higher-than-normal price. A $129.99 collector’s edition will be available on that day, too. It includes a physical copy of Tears of the Kingdom, an art book, SteelBook case, an Iconart steel poster, and four pins.

When Breath of the Wild was released in 2017, it launched on Nintendo Switch as a launch title as well as Wii U. Tears of the Kingdom will only be released on Nintendo Switch.

WILL AMIIBO WORK WITH TEARS OF THE KINGDOM?
Yes, although we have a suspicion that Nintendo hasn’t shared all of the details on amiibo Tears of the Kingdom compatibility. We know that scanning certain Zelda amiibo will change the design of your glider, but perhaps there will be other functionality announced closer to the game’s release date.

Nintendo will also release a new amiibo figure of Link as he appears in Tears of the Kingdom, and you can already pre-order it.
