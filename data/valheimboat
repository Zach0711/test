Longships are large boats with a high sailing speed, a high amount of storage and a poor maneuverability.

Karves are medium boats with a medium sailing speed, a small amount of storage and good manoeuvrability.

Rafts are small boats with a low sailing speed, no storage and poor manoeuvrability. Their extremely low cost of construction makes them ideal "disposable" solutions to overcoming water obstacles while exploring, but they are not a good choice for long ocean voyages.
